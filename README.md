# Attempts were made to place a quantitative limit on the detection of acoustic oscillation modes in the late main-sequence of K and M dwarf stars to be observed by the European Space Agencyâ€™s PLATO mission. An extensive catalogue of frequency-power spectra was successfully modelled for K and M dwarf stars using simulated data from TRILEGAL. Detection techniques were tested on the modelled spectra; these were a combination of manual and automatic Gaussian fitting and power-integration methods. From the 40 brightest K and M dwarfs modelled, oscillation modes were only successfully detected for the brightest K dwarf with magnitude 7.319. It was concluded that PLATO would only be able to observe oscillation modes in stars as bright or brighter than this. The detection methods could be refined to potentially improve this limit.
